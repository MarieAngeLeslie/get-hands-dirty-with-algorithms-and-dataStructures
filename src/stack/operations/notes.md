Main stack operations
    • Push (int data): Inserts data onto stack (at the beginning of the list if implemented with list).
    • int Pop(): Removes and returns the last inserted element from the stack.(Pop operation is implemented by deleting the node from the beginning (the header/top node))

Auxiliary stack operations
    • int Top(): Returns the last inserted element without removing it.
    • int Size(): Returns the number of elements stored in the stack.
    • int IsEmptyStack(): Indicates whether any elements are stored in the stack or not.
    • int IsFullStack(): Indicates whether the stack is full or not.



Direct applications
    • Balancing of symbols
    • Infix-to-postfix conversion
    • Evaluation of postfix expression
    • Implementing function calls (including recursion)
    • Finding of spans (finding spans in stock markets, refer to Problems section)
    • Page-visited history in a Web browser [Back Buttons]
    • Undo sequence in a text editor
    • Matching Tags in HTML and XML

Indirect applications
    • Auxiliary data structure for other algorithms (Example: Tree traversal algorithms)
    • Component of other data structures (Example: Simulating queues, refer Queues
